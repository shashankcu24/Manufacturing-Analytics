**📊 Manufacturing Analytics**

A data analytics project focused on understanding production performance, rejection trends, machine efficiency, and employee productivity using Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and SQL.

**🔍 Project Overview**
This project analyzes manufacturing data to identify key patterns that impact quality, cost, and output. Dashboards were created across multiple tools to provide clear insights into production flow, rejection rates, delivery performance, and cost implications.

**🛠 Tools & Techniques**

**SQL**: Data cleaning, transformation, KPI calculations

**Excel**: Base KPIs, monthly production trends, department analysis

**Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for trend and performance insights

**Power BI**: Machine-level, employee-level, and cost-focused analytics

📈 **Key Insights**

Departments show varying rejection and production efficiency

High rejection directly increases cost and reduces profitability

Machine utilization is uneven—few machines produce majority output

Employee efficiency varies widely

Acceptance rate stays around ~90%

Delivery delays impact specific buyers

**🎯 Outcome**

The project provides a unified analytical view of the manufacturing process, helping identify bottlenecks, quality issues, and opportunities for improving productivity and reducing losses.
